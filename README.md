# Tackle Box

Imagine if the fishing part of Animal Crossing was its own game. That's essentially what Tackle Box will be once it is done. Although it will expand on the mechanics a bit to make it more interesting.

Still not very fun to play, but it's getting there. I predict I will finish the game about late November to early December, 2018.
